    <img src="../images/pizza.jpeg" alt="pizzapic">
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish that has gained worldwide popularity. It typically consists of a round, flat bread base topped with various ingredients and baked in an oven. The base is made from a simple dough of flour, water, yeast, salt, and sometimes olive oil, which is then stretched or rolled out into a thin, circular shape.</p>
    <p>The toppings on a pizza can vary widely depending on regional preferences and personal taste. Common ingredients include tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and a variety of additional toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, sausage, ham, or fresh basil. Vegetarian options can include vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, artichokes, or eggplant. Some pizzas may also include specialty ingredients like anchovies, prosciutto, or buffalo mozzarella.</p>
    <p>Pizza is commonly enjoyed as a main course and is a popular choice for delivery or takeout. It is also a favorite food for social gatherings, parties, and casual meals. Additionally, there are various styles of pizza around the world, with different regions having their own unique variations, such as Neapolitan pizza, New York-style pizza, Chicago deep-dish pizza, and more.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (around 110°F/43°C)</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional additional toppings: sliced tomatoes, sliced fresh mozzarella, sliced pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, sliced onions, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, and salt. Add the yeast mixture to the bowl and stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a little more water.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 500-550°F or 260-290°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough to remove any air bubbles. Divide it into two portions for two pizzas (you can adjust the size based on your preference).</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out each dough portion into a thin round or rectangular shape, about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or a pizza peel if you're using a pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add any additional toppings of your choice, such as fresh basil leaves, sliced tomatoes, or other desired ingredients. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet directly into the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the second portion of dough if making two pizzas.</li>
        <li>Serve the homemade pizza hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
