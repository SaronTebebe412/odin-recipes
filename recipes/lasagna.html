        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that consists of multiple layers of flat pasta sheets, typically with a
        filling of meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. The dish is then baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked and the
        flavors meld together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, lasagna includes ingredients such as ground beef, Italian sausage, onions, garlic, herbs (such as
        basil and oregano), tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese.
        These ingredients are layered between the pasta sheets to create a hearty and flavorful casserlie.

        Lasagna is known for its rich and comforting taste, making it a favorite dish for family gatherings, special
        occasions, and potluck dinners. It can be accompanied by a side salad and garlic bread to complete the meal.

        There are variations of lasagna that cater to different dietary preferences or regional influences. For example,
        vegetarian lasagna may use vegetables like spinach or mushrooms as a filling instead of meat. Some variations
        also incorporate seafood or white sauce instead of tomato sauce.
